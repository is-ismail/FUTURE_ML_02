# FUTURE_ML_02  
📊 Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction Dashboard Using Power BI and Python

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data and visualizing key business insights using **Power BI**.  
The dashboard enables stakeholders to understand churn behavior, identify high-risk customers, and monitor key churn-related KPIs through interactive visuals.

The primary objective is to support **data-driven customer retention strategies**.
